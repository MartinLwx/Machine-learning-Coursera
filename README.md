## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal learning record for the famous Machine learning course in Coursera taught by Andrew ng. 

While I had previously taken this course, I had not completed the assignments as they were written in Octave. However, I recently discovered a repository that offered a Python version of the assignments, which motivated me to retake the course.


## Resources

Coursera page: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>

This repo is originally forked from <https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments>. 


## Assiginments

> Note: I **don't have** the submission token and only pass the tests in the jupyter notebook, so the solutions **may** be wrong.
