## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal learning record for the famous Machine learning course in Coursera taught by Andrew ng. 

While I had previously taken this course, I had not completed the assignments as they were written in Octave. However, I recently discovered a repository that offered a Python version of the assignments, which motivated me to retake the course.


## Resources

Coursera page:
- [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms)

This repo is originally forked from <https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments>. 

> Please note that as of June 2022, the official assignments have been rewritten in Python and are now available exclusively through a paid subscription. To access the latest assignments, kindly refer to the official homepage and subscribe.

## Assiginments

> Note: The official assignments are updated and not free anymore, so the solutions **are not** submitted to the official grader.
